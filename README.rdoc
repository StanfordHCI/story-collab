== Notes

* If errors happen, `bundle update` and `rake db:migrate` are your friends!

== Setup
* You need to temporarily comment out the devise call in app/models/user.rb and the devise_for call in config/routes.rb
* Run rails g devise:install
* Run rake db:migrate
* Uncomment out the lines in user.rb and routes.rb (or just check them out again)
* Rename /config/initializers/devise.rb.sample to devise.rb and modify the Facebook APP_ID and SECRET.
* Run rails server and you're up and running!
